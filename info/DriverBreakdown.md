### 1. Core Operational Modes (The State Machine)
These are the most fundamental functions that control the chip's primary state. Think of the SX1262 as having several modes: Sleep, Standby (idle), Transmitting, Receiving, etc. These functions command the chip to move between those states.

*   `sx126x_set_sleep()`: **Puts the chip into its lowest-power state.** The SPI interface is off. This is essential for battery-powered devices. You must use `sx126x_wakeup()` to bring it out of this state.
*   `sx126x_set_standby()`: **Puts the chip in an idle, low-power state.** The chip is awake and ready to receive commands instantly, but the radio is not active. This is the default state to return to after a TX or RX operation.
*   `sx126x_set_tx()`: **Puts the chip into Transmit mode.** After calling this, the radio will transmit the packet currently in its buffer. It takes a timeout to prevent the chip from getting stuck in TX mode.
*   `sx126x_set_rx()`: **Puts the chip into Receive mode.** It will listen for an incoming packet. You can set a timeout or have it listen continuously (`SX126X_RX_CONTINUOUS`).
*   `sx126x_set_cad()`: **Puts the chip into Channel Activity Detection mode.** This is a special "listen before talk" mode to check if the channel is already in use by another LoRa device before you transmit.
*   `sx126x_reset()` & `sx126x_wakeup()`: **(HAL Wrappers)** These are your entry points to the HAL. `reset` performs a hard reset via the RST pin. `wakeup` is used to bring the chip out of `sleep` mode.

### 2. Radio Configuration (The "Setup" Phase)
Before you can transmit or receive, you must configure *how* the radio should operate. These functions are typically called once during initialization. **Parameters must match on both the sender and receiver.**

*   `sx126x_set_pkt_type()`: **This is the first and most important configuration step.** It tells the chip if you will be using LoRa or GFSK modulation. This determines which other functions are valid.
*   `sx126x_set_rf_freq()`: Sets the carrier frequency (e.g., 915 MHz for North America).
*   `sx126x_set_pa_cfg()` and `sx126x_set_tx_params()`: Configures the power amplifier. You use these to set the **transmit power in dBm**.
*   `sx126x_set_reg_mode()`: Configures the internal power regulator (LDO vs. DC-DC). This depends on your specific module's hardware design. DC-DC is more efficient if available.
*   `sx126x_set_lora_mod_params()`: Sets the core LoRa modulation parameters: **Spreading Factor (SF)**, **Bandwidth (BW)**, and **Coding Rate (CR)**.
*   `sx126x_set_lora_pkt_params()`: Sets the LoRa packet structure: **Preamble length**, header type (explicit/implicit), and whether to use a **CRC**.

### 3. Data Transfer (Getting Data In and Out)
These functions are for moving your message payload to and from the radio's internal 256-byte RAM buffer.

*   `sx126x_write_buffer()`: **Loads your message into the radio's TX buffer.** You call this *before* calling `sx126x_set_tx()`.
*   `sx126x_read_buffer()`: **Reads the received message from the radio's RX buffer.** You call this *after* you get an `RX_DONE` interrupt.
*   `sx126x_set_buffer_base_address()`: Allows you to define separate start locations for the TX and RX buffers within the 256-byte RAM, preventing them from overwriting each other.

### 4. Interrupts & DIO Control (The "Event" System)
For efficient, non-blocking operation, you don't want to constantly ask the chip "are you done yet?". Instead, you tell the chip to signal you on a physical pin (DIO1) when an event occurs.

*   `sx126x_set_dio_irq_params()`: **The master configuration function for interrupts.** You use this to map internal radio events (like `SX126X_IRQ_TX_DONE` or `SX126X_IRQ_RX_DONE`) to the physical DIO pins.
*   `sx126x_get_irq_status()`: Checks which event flags have been triggered (e.g., a packet was sent, a CRC error occurred).
*   `sx126x_clear_irq_status()`: **Crucially, you must call this to reset the event flags** after you have handled an interrupt. This allows new interrupts to be triggered.
*   `sx126x_get_and_clear_irq_status()`: A convenient helper that combines the get and clear operations.

### 5. Status & Information (Querying the Radio)
These functions are used to get information about the radio's state or the quality of the last received packet. They are essential for debugging and monitoring link quality.

*   `sx126x_get_status()`: A vital debugging tool. Returns the current chip mode (e.g., `SX126X_CHIP_MODE_STBY_RC`) and the status of the last command.
*   `sx126x_get_rx_buffer_status()`: **Essential for reception.** After an `RX_DONE` event, this tells you the **length of the received packet** and its **start position** in the buffer, which you need to pass to `sx126x_read_buffer()`.
*   `sx126x_get_lora_pkt_status()`: Gives you the radio-level stats of the last received packet: **RSSI** (signal strength) and **SNR** (signal-to-noise ratio).
*   `sx126x_get_device_errors()`: Checks for low-level hardware errors, like a failed PLL lock or calibration issue.

### 6. Utility & Low-Level Functions
This is a catch-all for helpers and direct register access.

*   `sx126x_get_lora_time_on_air_in_ms()`: Calculates how long a given LoRa packet will take to transmit. Useful for power calculations and regulatory compliance.
*   `sx126x_set_lora_sync_word()`: Changes the LoRa sync word. All devices that want to communicate must use the same sync word.
*   `sx126x_cal()`: Manually triggers calibration of the radio's internal components (oscillators, ADC).
*   `sx126x_..._workaround()`: These are internal functions that apply fixes for specific hardware errata mentioned in the datasheet. You generally don't call them directly; they are called by the public-facing functions.
